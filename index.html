        <h2>About The Town</h2>
        <p class="about-carrick">Carrick-on-Suir is situated in the south-eastern corner of South Tipperary. 
            Most of the town lies north of the river in the townland of Carrig MÃ³r, 
            with the remainder of the town on the opposite bank in the townland of Carrig Beg.
            Carrick-on-Suir formed on an island settlement upstream of Waterford. 
            The town remained as an island until the 18th century when small rivers were diverted to form dry land north and west of the town.
            The town is connected to Limerick and Waterford by the N24 road and a rail link.
            There is a recently refurbished riverside walk to Clonmel named the Blueway allowing visitors to walk or cycle along a scenic riverside path. 
            This has recently been upgraded and replanted.</p>
